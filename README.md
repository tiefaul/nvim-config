### This repo is supposed to be used as config for my NeoVim. The original starter config was from NvChad

1. Ensure you have NeoVim version 0.11.4 or later installed.
2. Copy the contents of the `nvim-config` folder into your ~/.config/nvim/ directory.
3. Remove the `.git` folder after copying.
4. Update file ownership to your user account:
```bash
chown -R user:user ~./config/nvim
 ```
